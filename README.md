# PCP-Website
This website is based around the company called 'Personal Computer Pro' in Lexington, T.N. Our class had to try to find a good program to make our website on that was preferrably free. We had first found CodePen, but we later found out that it wasn't a program that teams could work together on at the same time. We ended up having to use Cloud9, which in our case is not free. It took us some time to find Cloud9 and that wasted some time off of our development on this website. Initially me and my partner, Elijah, were working on a different workspace, but that workspace ended up going bad so we just decided to restart, and I believe that is what cost us to not finish this website in time. We also had a lot of trouble with the nav bar, but we finally figured out a solution. I had a bit of trouble learning Responsive CSS, but, in the end, my partner, Elijah, had figured out a way to utilize Responsive CSS enough to get our website half responsive. It isn't the best it could be, but it works as of now. The program that we learned our HTML and CSS off of is called 'Codecademy'. I personally think it was a great learning platform, but the rest of my class didn't agree. Although it took us some time to make this website, I was able to finish up the most part of it with simple HTML and CSS changes. The website I present to you here is the final edit that we have, since we ran out of time.
